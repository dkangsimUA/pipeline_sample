This github repository is to demonstrate what works and what does not work for uploading QSF files to the server. 

Sample QSF files and scripts are saved in the repository for you to reproduce the error message. 
Simply clone this repo to RStudio and open `run_this_pipleine.R` and compare the output for the COLOBMIA and MEXICO. 

**The COLOMBIA script runs without error, but the MEXICO does.**
